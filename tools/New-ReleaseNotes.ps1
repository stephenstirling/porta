## Download and run

1. Download **$zip** below and unzip it.
2. Run **Porta.exe**. If Windows SmartScreen says "Windows protected your PC", click **More info**, then **Run anyway**.

Porta is signed with a **self-made certificate**, not a paid one, so SmartScreen will still warn. That is expected. You do **not** need to install the certificate or mark it as trusted, and you should not.

To remove Porta, end **Porta.exe** in Task Manager (or use the tray icon's *Exit Porta*) and delete the folder. The normal Start menu comes straight back.

## Verify your download

- **Checksum:** in PowerShell, run ``Get-FileHash .\$zip -Algorithm SHA256`` and compare it with the line for $zip in **SHA256SUMS.txt**.
- **Who built it:** with the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), run ``gh attestation verify .\$zip -R $Repo``. This proves the zip was built by this repository's release workflow.
- **Signature:** right-click ``Porta.exe`` > Properties > Digital Signatures > Details > View Certificate. The certificate thumbprint should be:

``````
$Thumbprint
``````

  The public certificate is attached as **Porta-signing.cer** (for comparing only). Windows will say the signature's root is not trusted; that is expected for a self-signed certificate.
