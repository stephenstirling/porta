<#
  Makes Porta's self-signed code-signing certificate. Run this ONCE, on your own PC.

  It creates, outside the project (never committed):
    %USERPROFILE%\PortaSigning\Porta-signing.pfx   the PRIVATE key + certificate, protected by a random password
    %USERPROFILE%\PortaSigning\Porta-signing.cer   the PUBLIC certificate (safe to share; goes in the releases)
    Documents\Porta-signing-password.txt           the password (move it into your password manager, then delete it)

  The password is never shown on screen. The certificate is NOT installed on this PC or marked as trusted.

  GitHub secrets, two ways:
    -SetSecrets   sends both to GitHub for you with the GitHub CLI (`gh`), nothing printed or pasted
    (default)     walks you through pasting them on the GitHub website
